# UFO

## Overview of Project:
In this project we used JavaScript to enhance the user experience using functions, filters and customization by creating dynamic webpages. we have apply HTML and Bootstrap skills to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript.
Multiple filter criteria is used and added table filters for the city, state, country and shape to filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria.
 
 ### Deliverables
1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

### Software Used
JavaScript, conda 4.10.3

## Results:
The new webpage is dynamic with multiple filter criteria. Depending upon value added in filter fields data will get filtered and display in the table. Below are the filter criteria and results

### Without any Filter displaying all data 



### With date filter showing only date added on filter


### With city filter showing only city added on filter




### With state filter showing only state added on filter




### With shape filter showing only shape added on filter



## Summary:

### Drawback : 
The one drawback of new design is that there is no clear button to clear out all the data. user need to manually clear each field if search critera gets changed. One other drawback can be if there is lots of data then every time 
when user enters the value in one field the data is getting filter out one by one. It can take too much time and can impact performance.

### Recommendations : 
1. Should add one clear button to clear out all the data in one go.

2. Should add Search button to filter out table data to improve performance for large data.
